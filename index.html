      Hey! My name is Keyla Welcome, yes you read that right my last name is actually WELCOME. I am deeply passionate about coding with a growing interest in artificial intelligence, robotics, cybersecurity. Over the past two years, I’ve immersed myself in learning how to code, starting from the basics and steadily building my skills. I find immense joy in solving problems and creating efficient, elegant solutions through programming. Technology has always fascinated me, and I’m excited to be part of a field where there’s always something new to learn and discover.

    <p class="about">
      As an aspiring software engineer, my ultimate goal is to work at the intersection of AI, robotics, and cybersecurity. I’m fascinated by the potential of AI to revolutionize industries, from smart robots that can improve daily life to systems that protect against evolving cyber threats. I want to design intelligent systems that not only solve complex problems but also have a meaningful impact on society. Whether it’s building autonomous robots, creating secure systems, or exploring cutting-edge AI research, I’m driven by the idea of crafting technology that pushes boundaries, i actually dream of owning a smart home!
    </p>

    <p class="about">My biggest inspiration for pursuing this journey is my four amazing kids. They motivate me every day to chase my dreams and show them that anything is possible with hard work and dedication. I want to create a future where they see that technology can solve problems, make life easier, and open up endless opportunities. Everything I do is for them, and I hope to inspire them to follow their passions, just as I’m following mine.</p>
